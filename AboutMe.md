## About me:
     hello my name is Brandon Flynn. I am currently on my senior year in Computer Science. I have taken Cps 1-3, assembly language, and language processing. I am currently taking object oriented programming, Web programming, and operating systems. The only language that i have real experience with is Java and soon to be html/css. 

     I am excited to dive deeper into html, css and javascript to fully see what can be done with it. With the knowledge i gain from this class, I hope to be able to start creating websites whether it would be for myself or for other people and businesses. If i could use my programming knowledge to help in a marketing sense, I would be very content.
